# Multi-Stage Ethical Hacking Challenge

This challenge is split into three interconnected stages. Solve each step to unlock the next and eventually find the final flag.

## Stage 1 - Reverse Engineering (stage1.py)
Analyze the given Python script and reverse engineer the obfuscated string to get the first flag.

## Stage 2 - Decryption (stage2.enc)
Use the first flag as the decryption key (SHA-256 hashed) to decrypt this file and obtain the second flag.

## Stage 3 - Zip Cracking (stage3.zip)
Use the second flag as the password to extract `flag3.txt` from the zip file. The contents of this file are the final flag to submit.

Store your Codes into 1 PDF File with the FINAL FLAG and Submit your File to CAMU.

Good luck!
